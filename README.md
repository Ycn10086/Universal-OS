# Universal-OS
A brand-new universal operating system. 
**A brand-new universal operating system.**
It transforms the traditional app store into a “task library” or “module marketplace,” fully integrated with the OS (see image for the visual concept). Then, through a program runner, these “tasks” are automatically assembled into a complete application—similar to Bubble.
In this model, major software companies evolve into module suppliers, producing only “sub-tasks” or “plugin modules,” such as an “instant messaging module” or an “image rendering module.” Users or other developers can then combine these modules to build their own applications.
